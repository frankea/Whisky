# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-08)

**Core value:** Every tracking issue (#40-#50) has a concrete response -- code fix, configuration UI, or in-app guidance
**Current focus:** Phase 3 - Process Lifecycle Management

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 10 (Process Lifecycle Management)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase (03-01 complete)
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-09 -- Completed 03-01-PLAN.md (Process types and Wine helpers)

Progress: [▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░] 27%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 8
- Average duration: 11.3min
- Total execution time: 1.55 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-miscellaneous-fixes | 3 | 17min | 5.7min |
| 02-configuration-foundation | 4 | 73min | 18.3min |
| 03-process-lifecycle-management | 1 | 3min | 3.0min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-01 (5min), 02-03 (16min), 02-02 (45min), 02-04 (7min), 03-01 (3min)
- Trend: variable (complex refactoring vs pure type/helper tasks)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 10 phases derived from 54 requirements at comprehensive depth
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 closes out existing PR #79 before starting new work
- [Roadmap]: EnvironmentBuilder refactor (Phase 2) is the foundation; graphics/audio/game phases depend on it
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3-4 are parallel-capable after foundation; Phases 5-6 are parallel-capable
- [01-01]: ClipboardPolicy/ClipboardCheckResult defined at module scope for easier import
- [01-01]: Structured result pattern: WhiskyKit returns result enums, app layer presents UI
- [01-01]: BottleCleanupConfig follows existing config section pattern (private stored, proxy properties)
- [01-02]: ClickOnce badge uses else-if after PE arch badge (mutually exclusive)
- [01-02]: Rescan button in toolbar for discoverability
- [01-02]: ClickOnce context menu in separate Section from standard actions
- [01-03]: Clipboard check called from app layer (ProgramItemView) rather than inside WhiskyKit's launchWithUserMode
- [01-03]: Startup zombie process sweep deferred to Phase 3 (ProcessRegistry is session-based)
- [01-03]: CleanupConfigSection extracted to own file for SwiftLint type_body_length compliance
- [02-01]: EnvironmentBuilder uses [String: String?] per layer to support explicit key removal via nil
- [02-01]: DLLOverrideResolver.managed uses tuple array (entry, source) instead of separate dictionaries
- [02-01]: displayName on DLLOverrideMode uses plain strings (localization deferred to UI phase)
- [02-01]: Added Sendable to EnhancedSync and DXVKHUD enums for ProgramOverrides compatibility
- [02-03]: Verb discovery methods placed in separate extension file for SwiftLint length compliance
- [02-03]: MainActor.run used to safely read bottle.url from non-isolated async contexts
- [02-03]: Both prefix root and drive_c checked for winetricks.log location
- [02-02]: Kept environmentVariables(wineEnv:) as deprecated wrapper for backward compatibility
- [02-02]: DLLOverrideResolver produces per-DLL alphabetically sorted format (valid Wine syntax)
- [02-02]: Extracted isValidEnvKey to extension to satisfy SwiftLint type_body_length
- [02-02]: ProgramOverrides passed through Wine.runProgram rather than changing generateEnvironment return type
- [02-04]: Inherit/override toggle uses nil-check on grouped fields (no separate boolean tracking)
- [02-04]: Copy-on-enable copies current bottle values when switching from inherit to override
- [02-04]: taggedVerbs excluded from ProgramOverrides.isEmpty (organizational metadata, not settings override)
- [02-04]: Advanced raw WINEDLLOVERRIDES escape hatch deferred per discretion clause
- [03-01]: ProcessKind.classify uses static Set<String> lookup for O(1) classification
- [03-01]: parseTasklistOutput is a pure non-MainActor function for testability
- [03-01]: clearRegistry made public for ViewModel shutdown cleanup
