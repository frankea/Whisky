## Overview

Steam is the most widely used game launcher in Whisky, but also has the most compatibility issues (~50 related upstream issues). This guide provides comprehensive setup and troubleshooting specifically for Steam.

---

## Quick Setup (Recommended Configuration)

### Step 1: Create Dedicated Steam Bottle

1. **Create New Bottle:**
   - Name: "Steam"
   - Windows Version: **Windows 10** (recommended)
   - Location: Default

2. **Enable Launcher Compatibility:**
   - Config → Launcher Compatibility
   - Toggle "Launcher Compatibility Mode" **ON**
   - Detection Mode: **Automatic**

3. **Verify Auto-Detection:**
   - When you launch Steam, it should auto-detect
   - "Detected Launcher: Steam" will appear

### Step 2: Install Steam

1. **Download Steam Installer:**
   - https://store.steampowered.com/about/
   - Download Windows version (SteamSetup.exe)

2. **Run Installer:**
   - Bottle → Run → Select SteamSetup.exe
   - Follow installation wizard
   - Install to default location (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\)

3. **First Launch:**
   - After installation, Steam should launch automatically
   - **If steamwebhelper crash occurs:** See troubleshooting below

### Step 3: Configure for Optimal Performance

1. **Leave the graphics backend on Recommended:**
   - Steam's own processes (steam.exe, steamwebhelper.exe, steamservice.exe)
     get DXVK through per-executable overrides, so the client draws on DXVK
     while the games it starts keep the bottle's backend. With the D3DMetal
     payload that is D3DMetal, which DirectX 12 games need.
   - Setting the whole bottle to DXVK turns d3d12 off for every game when the
     payload is deployed; only do it for a bottle whose games all want DXVK.

2. **Adjust Network Timeout:**
   - Config → Launcher Compatibility
   - Set timeout to **90 seconds** (recommended for Steam)

3. **Enable GPU Spoofing:**
   - Config → Launcher Compatibility
   - GPU Spoofing: **ON**
   - Vendor: **NVIDIA** (best compatibility)

### Step 4: Verify Configuration

1. **Generate Diagnostics:**
   - Config → Launcher Compatibility
   - Click "Generate Diagnostics Report"

2. **Check Critical Settings:**
   ```
   LC_ALL = en_US.UTF-8          ✅ (prevents steamwebhelper crash)
   STEAM_DISABLE_CEF_SANDBOX = 1  ✅ (Wine compatibility)
   STEAM_RUNTIME = 0              ✅ (Wine compatibility)
   DXVK_ASYNC = 1                 ✅ (UI performance)
   ```

3. **Look for Warnings:**
   - ✅ "Configuration is optimal" → Good to go!
   - ⚠️ Any warnings → Follow recommendations

## Common Steam Issues

### Issue 1: "steamwebhelper is not responding"

**This is the #1 Steam issue (~50% of all Steam problems)**

#### Symptoms:
- Steam window shows error immediately after launch
- "steamwebhelper.exe is not responding" dialog
- Options to restart/wait don't help
- Steam UI completely unusable

#### Root Cause:
Steam's Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) crashes when:
- Locale doesn't specify UTF-8 encoding
- ICU (International Components for Unicode) fails to initialize
- Date/time parsing encounters unexpected format

#### Solution:

**Critical Fix - Locale:**
1. Config → Launcher Compatibility → Enable
2. Locale Override → **English**
3. Generate diagnostics → Verify `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`

**Important:** The `.UTF-8` suffix is CRITICAL. `en_US` alone will still crash!

#### Verification:
```
✅ LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 (correct)
❌ LC_ALL=en_US (missing .UTF-8 - will crash!)
```

#### If Still Crashes:
1. Delete Steam installation
2. Recreate bottle with compatibility mode enabled FIRST
3. Install Steam fresh
4. Verify locale before first launch

**Related Issues:**
- whisky-app/whisky#946 (Primary issue - 30+ comments)
- whisky-app/whisky#1224 (UI unusable)
- whisky-app/whisky#1241 (Locale fix discovery)

---

### Issue 2: Downloads Stall at 99%

#### Symptoms:
- Download progress reaches 99%
- Never completes
- "Download starting..." message loops
- Requires Steam restart
- Happens with multiple games

#### Root Cause:
Wine's HTTP/2 implementation has connection pooling issues. Downloads use persistent connections that timeout incorrectly.

#### Solution:

**Primary Fix:**
1. Config → Launcher Compatibility
2. Network Timeout → **90 seconds** (or higher)
3. Restart Steam

**In-Steam Workaround:**
1. Steam → Settings → Downloads
2. Change "Download Region" to different location
3. Pause and resume download
4. Clear download cache

**Verify Environment:**
```
WINHTTP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT = 90000
WINHTTP_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT = 180000
WINE_FORCE_HTTP11 = 1
WINE_MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_SERVER = 10
```

**Why This Works:**
- Longer timeouts prevent premature connection closure
- HTTP/1.1 fallback avoids Wine's HTTP/2 bugs
- Connection pooling limits prevent resource exhaustion

**Related Issues:**
- whisky-app/whisky#1148 (Downloads stall)
- whisky-app/whisky#1072 (Download freezes)
- whisky-app/whisky#991 (Restart required)
- whisky-app/whisky#1222 (Freeze requiring restart)

---

### Issue 3: Steam Disconnects Repeatedly

#### Symptoms:
- "No connection" errors every few minutes
- Have to reconnect repeatedly
- Download progress lost
- Friends list disconnects

#### Root Cause:
Network keepalive timeouts and SSL handshake issues.

#### Solution:

1. **Increase Timeout:**
   - Network Timeout → 120 seconds or higher

2. **Verify SSL Settings:**
   - Generate diagnostics
   - Check `WINE_ENABLE_SSL=1`
   - Check `WINE_SSL_VERSION_MIN=TLS1.2`

3. **Check macOS Network:**
   - System Settings → Network
   - Verify stable connection
   - Disable any VPN temporarily (test)

**Related Issues:**
- whisky-app/whisky#1176 (Disconnects)
- whisky-app/whisky#954 (Slow connectivity)

---

### Issue 4: Steam UI Blurry or Stuttering

#### Symptoms:
- Text appears blurry or pixelated
- UI animations stutter
- Scrolling is choppy
- Window dragging lags

#### Solution:

**Enable DXVK:**
1. Config → DXVK → Toggle ON
2. Enable "DXVK Async"
3. Restart Steam

**Adjust DPI (if blurry):**
1. Config → Wine → DPI Configuration
2. Try 96 DPI (standard) or 192 DPI (Retina)

**Why This Helps:**
DXVK provides better GPU acceleration for Steam's UI rendering, reducing stuttering and improving visual quality.

**Related Issues:**
- whisky-app/whisky#1256 (Blurry text and stuttering)
- whisky-app/whisky#1233 (Window dragging issues)

---

### Issue 5: Steam Opens But No UI Visible

#### Symptoms:
- Steam process running (Activity Monitor shows it)
- No window appears
- Or window appears but completely blank
- Can hear notification sounds

#### Solution:

1. **Kill Steam Process:**
   - Bottle → "Kill All Processes"

2. **Enable Compatibility Mode:**
   - If not already enabled

3. **Check Graphics Settings:**
   - Enable DXVK
   - Disable Metal Validation (if enabled)
   - Enable Sequoia Compat Mode (macOS 15+)

4. **Verify CEF Sandbox:**
   - Generate diagnostics
   - Must have `CEF_DISABLE_SANDBOX=1`

**If Still Invisible:**
- Delete Steam, reinstall fresh
- Check ~/Library/Logs/com.franke.Whisky/ for errors

**Related Issues:**
- whisky-app/whisky#1183 (No UI)
- whisky-app/whisky#1009 (Blank window)

---

## macOS 15.4+ Specific Issues

### Issue: Steam Crashes After Updating to macOS 15.4.1

#### Symptoms:
- Steam worked fine on macOS 15.3
- After updating to 15.4 or 15.4.1, Steam won't start
- wine-preloader threads stuck
- Mach port timeouts

#### Root Cause:
Apple changed mach port and threading behavior in macOS 15.4, breaking Wine's process creation.

#### Solution:

1. **Enable Sequoia Compatibility:**
   - Config → Metal → "Sequoia Compat Mode" ON

2. **Verify macOS Fixes:**
   - Generate diagnostics
   - macOS Version should show 15.4 or higher
   - Check for these environment variables:
     ```
     WINEFSYNC = 0
     STEAM_RUNTIME = 0
     CEF_DISABLE_SANDBOX = 1
     ```

3. **Restart Bottle:**
   - Kill all Wine processes
   - Relaunch Steam

**Why This Happens:**
macOS 15.4 changed security model for process creation. Wine requires specific environment variables to work around these changes.

**Related Issues:**
- whisky-app/whisky#1372 (macOS 15.4.1 breaks Steam - PRIMARY)
- whisky-app/whisky#1310 (Graphics corruption)
- whisky-app/whisky#1307 (Sequoia compatibility)

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Launch Options
